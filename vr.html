            <h3><span>Augmented Reality</span></h3>
            <p1><br>Augmented Reality (AR) is an interactive experience of combining a real-world environment with enhancements provided by computer-generated (CG) perceptual information. Unlike VR, AR is not a  completely immersive, virtual experience. Virtual objects or displays lay over the real world with positional tracking, typically through a set of smart glasses, goggles, a monocle, or an HMD .This technology is especially useful for military and medical purposes as both require much focus and information in high-stress, timely scenarios.
              L&D understands the needs and challenges of working with AR. With tools like Unity, we will provide you with content that feels natural and realistic. Additionally, L&D can develop AR for all available headsets. Whether it is medical simulation, maintenance trainers, or enhancements, the limits of AR are boundless.
